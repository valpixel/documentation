    <b>Config documentation</b>
    <p>Allows you to save configs after you have set your cheat up, so you do not have to re-make them every time you start up the cheat</p>
    <p>Our config system is built of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>list of configs - all of your created configs will be shown here</li>
        <li>create config button - is used along with the text box next to it to create new config, your current settings will automatically save upon creation</li>
        <li>config text box - here you will type in your config name. Your config name must end with '.ini', as that is the config format that we use</li>
    </ul>
