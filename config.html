    <b>Config documentation</b>
    <p>Allows you to save configs after you have set your cheat up, so you do not have to re-make them every time you start up the cheat</p>
    <p>Our config system is built of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>list of configs - all of your created configs will be shown here</li>
        <li>create config button - is used along with the text box next to it to create new config, your current settings will automatically save upon creation</li>
        <li>config text box - here you will type in your config name. Your config name must end with '.ini', as that is the config format that we use</li>
        <li>save button - saves the current config you have selected from the config list</li>
        <li>load button - loads the current config you have selected from the config list</li>
        <li>delete button - deletes the current config you have selected from the config list</li>
        <li>open folder button - opens the directory path where all the configs are saved</li>
        <li>reload configs button - will reload the configs in the config list. Used when you manually create a config in the config folder/drag someone else's config in the config folder</li>
    </ul>
