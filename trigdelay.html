        <b>Delay documentation</b>
        <p>This will set a delay in between shots</p>
        <p>This is especially useful with pistols, where you do not want to spam, you want a slight delay in between your shots</p>
        <p>The delay is in milliseconds, and ranges from 1 to 1000ms</p>
        <p>We recommend the values around 250-500 for the best accuracy with most weapons</p>
