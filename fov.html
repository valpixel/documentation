    <b>FOV documentation</b>
    <p>We differentiate between two different modes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fov x - alters the horizontal fov of aimbot (ranges from 1 to 3840)</dt>
      <li>fov y - alters the vertical fov of aimbot (ranges from 1 to 2160)</dt>
    </ul>
    <p>This is basically the 'range' in which your aimbot will work</p>
    <p>The higher the value, the further your crosshair can be from your target</p>
    <p>The performance will become slower as you try to reach higher values, it shouldn't be much of a toll till around ~400 fov</p>
    <p>Your FOV should be at '30' at most for legit cheating, the aimbot can become obvious at higher values</p>
