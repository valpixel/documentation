    <b>Offset Y documentation</b>
    <p>Adjusts the final Y position of the aimbot</p>
    <p>This feature is to be used whenever you feel like your aimbot is aiming <b>above/below</b> the head</p>
    <ul>
        <li>aiming above the head? - increase the offset (e.g. from 0.00 to 2.00)</li>
        <li>aiming below the head? - decrease the offset (e.g. from 0.00 to -2.00)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Decimal places are used for the most perfect adjustments, generally you would set those up only when you were to find the perfect range for your aimbot</p>
    <p>Keep in mind, that decimal places are written as '.' not ','</p>
