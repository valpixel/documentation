    <b>Movement compensation documentation</b>
    <p>As this is an external cheat, there is a slight delay (16ms) before the cheat is able to move your mouse in-game</p>
    <p>This might seem like a tiny delay, but it is noticeable whilst you are moving</p>
    <p>This feature was made to compensate for it, henceforth the name 'Movement compensation'</p>
    <p>It will automatically add to the pixels lost if you would move without it whenever you are pressing either A/D</p>
    <p>It ranges from 1 to 10, from overall testing, values somewhere in the middle seem to work the best</p>
