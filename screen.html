    <b>Screen documentation</b>
    <p>One of the most important <b>components</b> of setting the cheat up; if you do not set this up correctly, the cheat will never work</p>
    <p>The values of screen x/y must be equal to your in-game resolution <b>NOT</b> your desktop resolution (if they are the same, it does not really matter)</p>
    <p>e.g. your Valorant resolution is 1600x900, but your default desktop resolution is 1920x1080. You <b>MUST</b> use the Valorant resolution => screen x = 1600; screen y = 900</p>
