    This is <b>speed documentation</b>
    <p>We differentiate between two different modes:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>speed x</dt>
      <dd>- alters the horizontal velocity of aimbot</dd>
      <dt>speed y</dt>
      <dd>- alters the vertical velocity of aimbot</dd>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, we recommend that your <b>horizontal</b> speed is <b>higher</b> than your <b>vertical</b> speed</p>
    <p><b>e.g.:</b> 'speed x = 0.900'; 'speed y = 0.350'</p>
    <p>The decimal places allow you to make precise adjustments to make the perfect adjustments to your aimbot</p>
    <br>
    <p>Higher values of speed make the aimbot less controllable, and vice-versa</p>
    <p>Higher values also make the aimbot shake, because the cheat is not able to process that fast of a movement</p>
